# What is FOF?

FOF (Framework on Framework) is a rapid application development framework for Joomla!.
Unlike other frameworks, it is not standalone. It extends the Joomla! Platform
instead of replacing it, featuring its own forked and extended version of the
MVC classes, keeping a strong resemblance to the existing Joomla! MVC API. This means
that you don't have to relearn writing Joomla! extensions. Instead, you can start
being productive from the first day you start using it. Our goal is to always support
the officially supported LTS versions of Joomla! and not break backwards compatibility
without a clear deprecation and migration path.

# Free Software means collaboration

The reason of existence of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is collaboration between developers. FoF is no exception; it exists because of and for the community of Joomla! developers. It is provided free of charge and with all of the freedoms of the GPL for you to benefit. And in true Free Software spirit, the community aspect is very strong. Participating is easy and fun.

If you want to discuss FoF, there is [a Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/frameworkonframework). This is a peer discussion group where developers working with FoF can freely discuss.

If you have a feature proposal or have found a bug, but you're not sure how to code it yourself, please report it on the list.

If you have a patch, feel free to fork this project on GitHub (you only need a free account to do that) and send a pull request. Please remember to describe what you intended to achieve to help me review your code faster.

If you've found a cool hack (in the benign sense of the word, not the malicious one...), something missing from the documentation or have a tip which can help other developers, feel free to edit the Wiki. We're all grown-ups and professionals, I believe there is no need of policing the wiki edits. If you're unsure about whether a wiki edit is appropriate, please ask on the list.
