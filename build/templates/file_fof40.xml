There's a reason this is a "files" package, not a "library" package.

When applying an update to a "library" package Joomla! will delete all of the library files BEFORE it executes the
installation script's preflight event. This means that any checks made there to prevent the installation (e.g. wrong PHP
or Joomla! version, or even preventing an accidental downgrade) results in the library being UNINSTALLED. This means
that when you try to install an unsupported version of a package extension that bundles a library, your site CRASHES AND
BURNS instead of the installation failing gracefully.

This is a catastrophic failure mode as far as we are concerned. It is a known Joomla! extensions installed issue since
~2017 but wouldn't be fixed in Joomla! 3 due to backwards compatibility. It's uncertain whether it will be fixed in
Joomla! 4.

The only thing we can do to prevent your sites from crashing if you try to install a version of FOF which does not
support your PHP and/or Joomla! versions is to deliver our library as a *files* package. While an architecturally wrong
solution, our primary concern is not breaking your sites. Hence us deciding to use a files package. We are not crazy. We
are making sure you won't be driven crazy by some quirky Joomla! extensions installer behavior decided a decade ago by a
person who's left the project many years ago. You're welcome!

		<b>WARNING</b>: This is NOT a duplicate of the FOF library already installed with Joomla! 3. It is a different version used by other extensions on your site. Do NOT uninstall either FOF package. If you do you will break your site.
