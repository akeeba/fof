Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* FOF has been rewritten in version 3 and breaks b/c. Good news: you can have FOF 2 and FOF 3 run side by side thanks to
  the new version using namespaces. Please consult the documentation wiki in the GitHub repository for information on
  how FOF 3 works.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2 follows a different development cycle. This CHANGELOG contains entries for FOF 3 only.
