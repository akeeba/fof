! Keep a Markdown file with FOF 3 to FOF 4 upgrade notices
    Removed the Form package
    Removed View\DataView\Form class
    Removed the LESS package, @less() Blade template and View::addLess() method
    FOF is looking in <libroot>/ViewTemplates (default: libraries/fof40/ViewTemplates) for fallback view templates. Document the default view templates in there.
    You can override default FOF templates in <templateFolder>/<TEMPLATE_NAME>/html/lib_fof40.

[x] Remove XML forms support
    [x] Remove Form package
    [x] Remove form support from Controller
    [x] Remove form support from Model
    [x] Remove form support from View
    [x] Remove form support from Factory

[x] Remove LESS integration

[x] Allow Blade to include common templates from FOF itself (<fofRoot>/ViewTemplates)

[x] View template suffixes for the Joomla version and renderer being used e.g. default.j39.fef.blade.php, default.j3.php, default.strapper.php. Parsed from most to least specific.

Import common Blade templates into <fofRoot>/ViewTemplates

Test ViewFinder

Blade constructs for common form elements, e.g @startEditWrapper / @endEditWrapper, @label, @startEditField / @endEditField, @checkBoxField -- render them through the renderer engine (or have the engine register a custom Blade compiler class, we may have to allow multiple compiler classes if we don't already do that)

Rewrite scaffolding (Layout) to produce Blade templates

Encrypt: mark MCrypt deprecated, cause it to throw a deprecated warning (set OpenSSL as the preferred implementation)

Transparent authentication: must use tokens (link it to work to be done in J4?)

Is HAL still relevant?

Input: provide custom implementation for CLI and files

Replace deprecated Joomla! class names with namespaced ones (requires bump in minimum supported Joomla! version)

Remove AkeebaStrapper renderer

Maybe refactor Utils\FEFHelper?
