    Removed the Form package
    Removed View\DataView\Form class
    Removed the LESS package, @less() Blade template and View::addLess() method
    FOF is looking in <libroot>/ViewTemplates (default: libraries/fof40/ViewTemplates) for fallback view templates. Document the default view templates in there.
    You can override default FOF templates in <templateFolder>/<TEMPLATE_NAME>/html/lib_fof40.

    Automatic suffixes on PHP and Blade view templates depending on the
    Joomla! version and renderer being used, parsed from most to least
    specific. For example:

    * default.j39.fef.php
    * default.j39.php
    * default.j3.fef.php
    * default.j3.php
    * default.fef.php
    * default.php

    This does not override the path priority which remains: template
    overrides, specified side of the application, opposite side of the
    application.

    If a less specific view template is found in a higher priority path it
    will be used instead. The idea being that a template override is always
    most specific as it's done for a specific site which runs a specific
    Joomla! version and for a specific component whose renderer you already
    know.

[x] Remove XML forms support
    [x] Remove Form package
    [x] Remove form support from Controller
    [x] Remove form support from Model
    [x] Remove form support from View
    [x] Remove form support from Factory

[x] Remove LESS integration

[x] Allow Blade to include common templates from FOF itself (<fofRoot>/ViewTemplates)

[x] View template suffixes for the Joomla version and renderer being used e.g. default.j39.fef.blade.php, default.j3.php, default.strapper.php. Parsed from most to least specific.

Import common Blade templates into <fofRoot>/ViewTemplates

Test ViewFinder

Dependency tracking in installation
    Remove dependency from FOF 3, add dependency to FOF 4 on install/upgrade
    Remove dependency from FOF 3 and FOF 4 on uninstall

Remove AkeebaStrapper renderer

Each renderer should add FEF extensions for the following elements:

    * `@sortgrid`
    * `@filedtitle`
    * `@modelfilter`
    * `@selectfilter`
    * `@searchfilter`

The default implementation can go through JHtml, I guess?


MAYBE Blade templates for common form elements, e.g @startEditWrapper / @endEditWrapper, @label, @startEditField / @endEditField, @checkBoxField -- defined by each Renderer


Rewrite scaffolding (Layout) to produce Blade templates


Encrypt: mark MCrypt deprecated, cause it to throw a deprecated warning (set OpenSSL as the preferred implementation)


Transparent authentication: must use tokens (link it to work to be done in J4?)


Is HAL still relevant?


Input: provide custom implementation for CLI and files


Replace deprecated Joomla! class names with namespaced ones (requires bump in minimum supported Joomla! version)
