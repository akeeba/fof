Allow Blade to include common templates from FOF itself (<fofRoot>/blade)

Import common Blade templates into <fofRoot>/blade

Blade constructs for common form elements, e.g @startEditWrapper / @endEditWrapper, @label, @startEditField / @endEditField, @checkBoxField -- render them through the renderer engine (or have the engine register a custom Blade compiler class, we may have to allow multiple compiler classes if we don't already do that)

Rewrite scaffolding (Layout) to produce Blade templates

Encrypt: mark MCrypt deprecated, cause it to throw a deprecated warning (set OpenSSL as the preferred implementation)

Transparent authentication: must use tokens (link it to work to be done in J4?)

Is HAL still relevant?

Input: provide custom implementation for CLI and files

Remove LESS integration

Replace deprecated Joomla! class names with namespaced ones (requires bump in minimum supported Joomla! version)

Remove AkeebaStrapper renderer

Maybe refactor Utils\FEFHelper?
