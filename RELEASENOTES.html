	<strong>THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION. FOF 3 IS NOW END OF LIFE.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This version of FOF 3 will remove any registered extension dependency information between extensions and FOF 3 or Akeeba Strapper. This means that FOF 3 and Akeeba Strapper can now be uninstalled without any complaints <em>even if</em> there are legacy extensions still using these end of life frameworks.
</p>

<p>
	We <strong>do NOT</strong> recommend upgrading your extensions to FOF 4; it is deprecated. Active development for FOF 4 will cease around Q2 and Q3 2022 when all of our own software is migrated to core Joomla 4 MVC. From that point it will be minimally maintained to support new versions of Joomla 4 and PHP up to and including 8.1. FOF 4 will become End of Life and FOF in general will be discontinued on August 17th, 2023. At this point the GitHub repository will be archived and public downloads for FOF will be removed from our site.
</p>

<p>
	We urge you to migrate your extensions to Joomla core MVC. Joomla 4 in particular has most of the features we introduced in FOF 2, 3 and 4 with the exception of the DataModel. There is the <a href="https://github.com/joomla-framework/entities">Joomla Entities</a> package which does some of what FOF's DataModel does, albeit with a more modern codebase. If you are heavily relying on DataModel you can look into that package.
</p>

<p>
	FOF came to life ten years ago as a way to push Joomla extension development forward. The fact that it's becoming End of Life is not a defeat; it's a win. FOF proved the point and its ideas made it into the core MVC for the most part. You can now maintain complex extensions with core Joomla 4 MVC. It took ten years but it's finally here. That's a major win for all of us Joomla extensions developers. So it's not so much killing off FOF as much as retiring it from active duty.

<p>
	So long and thanks for all the fish!
